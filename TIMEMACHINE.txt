Hi,
Nice to see you again. Here's what to do if you mess up everything and have to revert to a previous commit.

1. Find the last commit you want to revert to. Use "git log --graph --all" or look through GitHub's commits page to see if that commit has the files you want.
2. Do a hard reset. Use "git reset --hard (commit number prefix)"
3. Make sure you don't have anything to add or commit. Use "git status" excessively.
4. When you're sure you're ready, force push. Use "git push --force" and follow the prompts.
