# Project
An educational game produced for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control for elementary school students.

## Objectives:

* to educate students grades 2-7 about environmental impact
* to create a game that promotes learning as a fun activity
* to achieve each of these goals through an accurate representation of a local estuary

## Storyline:
You are a scuba diver in your local estuary. One day, your fish friend tells you he lost his other fish friend at the bottom of the estuary, so you must go on an adventure to find him. You are given a map that will lead you through 3 educational minigames to teach you about environmental impact. After completing the minigames, you will find your fish friend and win the game.
